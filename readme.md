## Introduction

Confusion in life is pretty common isn't it? Let me tell you my story. I started my career as a project manager, I couldn't handle so resigned to pursue data science. 8 months in the course and I started wondering whether this is the right field, did I make the right decision? After loads of thinking, I understood that analytics and statistics isn't what I need and decided not to continue anymore.

I like creating stuff, like to think out of the box. What better choice than software engineering can provide me with such qualities?

#### Past mistakes

During my college days, I had started learning web development, I think it was Colt Steele's course that I took. I finished the course and that's it, I understood the basics of HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. And so I assumed I was proficient in developing websites and ready to move on (_this is where I should've advanced deep into web dev/software engineering..._) Little did I know that I was just getting started, but I went on to choose a more "user-friendly" language, **Python**. I learnt the basics again, it was quite easy but I never really advanced further. By the time I realised that I had already graduated, _touche_.

So here I am, once again starting my journey in web development. But this time I will stick to this no matter how tough it gets in the coming days. The imposter syndrome has already kicked in, _will I be able to do it?_, _I don't think I'm capable of it, maybe software engineering isn't for me_. But I know I need to ignore that and work my way up.

**THIS IS REDEMPTION!**

## Day 01

Day 1 was chill, it always is. Here's what I learnt:

**HTML fundamentals**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta/> <!-- to define page's content -->
        <title> Title of the page </title>
    </head>

    <body> <!-- Everything on the webpage visible to user -->
        <header> <!-- The main part of the body goes here -->
            <h1> Heading tag with highest ranking </h1>
            <h6> Being the least ranked </h6>

            <nav> Navigation bar </nav>
        </header>

        <article> <!-- Next important content goes here -->
            <img src="some-image.jpg" alt="This is an image">
            <!-- Image tag, src -> source of the image, alt -> alternate text -->

            <p> Paragaph tag </p>
            <strong> Bold text </strong>
            <em> Emphazised/italic text </em>

            <a href="some-link"> Link explanation </a> <!-- hyperlink -->

            <ul> <!-- unordered list -->
                <li> list element </li>
            </ul>

            <ol> <!-- ordered list -->
                <li> List element </li>
            </ol>

            <button> Text on button </button>
        </article>

        <div> <!-- div tag is used instead of article when content isn't semantically related -->
        </div>

        <aside> Extra content in a page </aside>

        <footer> Footer of the webpage </footer>
    </body>
</html>

```

**CSS fundamentals**

```
inline:
    <h1 style="color:blue;">

internal:
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>

external: (different stylesheet)
    h1 {
        color: blue;
    }
```

**class**: can be repeated throughout the file
`<p class="class-name"> Some text </p>`

**id**: can be used only once (rarely used)
`<p id="id-name"> Some text </p>`
