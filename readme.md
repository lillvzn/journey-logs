## Introduction

Confusion in life is pretty common isn't it? I was confused as well, started my career as a project manager, I couldn't handle so I resigned to pursue data science. 8 months in the course and I started wondering whether this is the right field, did I make the right decision? After loads of thinking, I decided not to pursue data science anymore.

#### Past mistakes

During my college days, I had started learning web development, I think it was Colt Steele's course that I took. I finished the course and that's it, I understood the basics of HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. And so I assumed I was proficient in developing websites and ready to move on (_this is where I should've advanced deep into software engineering..._) Little did I know that I was just getting started, but I went on to choose a more "user-friendly" language, **Python**. I learnt the basics again, it was quite easy but I never really advanced further. By the time I realised that I had already graduated, _touche_.

So here I am, once again starting my journey in web development. But this time I will stick to this no matter how tough it gets in the coming days. The imposter syndrome has already kicked in, _will I be able to do it?_, _I don't think I'm capable of it, maybe software engineering isn't for me_. But I know I need to ignore that and work my way up.

**THIS IS REDEMPTION!**
